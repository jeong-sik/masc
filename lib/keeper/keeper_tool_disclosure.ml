(** Keeper_tool_disclosure — tool selection, usage tracking, and response normalization.

    Extracted from keeper_agent_run.ml as part of #5732 god-module split.
    Contains helpers for tool usage snapshots, delta computation, response
    validation, query text extraction, and tool selection boundary merging. *)
