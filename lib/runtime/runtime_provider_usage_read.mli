(** Asking a provider for its own usage windows without a model turn.

    [Runtime_provider_usage_window] hears a provider's windows only while a
    turn runs. An account the router stopped picking because it is spent runs
    no turn, so the operator never learns when it resets. This module asks
    the provider directly and records the answer in the same table, for the
    operator projection only: routing and admission do not read it.

    Codex answers [account/rateLimits/read] after account admission, with no
    thread or turn. A provider that declares [usage-read] in runtime.toml is
    asked with one HTTP GET to that URL, authenticated with the provider's own
    credentials, and the answer is decoded by the declared shape. *)
