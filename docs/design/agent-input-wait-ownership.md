# Agent input wait ownership

Reference: the [official MCP SDK elicitation contract](https://ts.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/servers/elicitation)
represents user action separately from submitted content. The distinction
supports explicit settlement here; this Agent API retains its own closed
Answer/Declined/Timeout vocabulary and does not claim MCP wire compatibility.

An input pause belongs to its original invocation and canonical request. An
agent name or question is display data; it cannot identify a pending request.
`Agent.pending_input` returns that owned `(run_id, request)` value. The run ID
is the same started invocation carried in `AgentInputRequired.task_id`, not
the separate raw-trace run ID in an outcome envelope. Invocation identities
exist with or without an event-bus subscriber. Request IDs use the existing
fresh-ID source rather than agent name, turn and timestamp.

`Agent.provide_input` takes this proof, checks both IDs under the Agent's state
lock, uses the owner's canonical question, appends an Answer message if needed,
and consumes the pending wait in the same mutation. Declined and Timeout are
explicit settlements without synthetic messages. An old, foreign or repeated
response returns a typed refusal and leaves the current request and messages
unchanged. A Timeout response is not automatic wall-clock expiry.

Publishing Started is not an accepted resume: input/callback validation can
still refuse the call. The shared input stage consumes only its captured
pending proof after the before-turn decision accepts continuation. This covers
sync, streaming, low-level `run_turn_stream` and Advanced continuation, including
a later failure and intermediate checkpoint. A replacement that arrived during
a callback is not consumed by the earlier captured identity. A new input pause
is installed before publishing its lifecycle outcome. Failed pre-resume calls
leave the old pending wait intact. Low-level streaming turns publish their own
Started and outcome rather than bypassing the invocation owner.

Checkpoint v12 persists `pending_input` explicitly, including null when no wait
is outstanding. Full encode/decode, message-encoding memo headers and checkpoint
deltas carry the same proof. Agent resume and clone preserve it. The public
checkpoint captures messages and pending ownership under the same Agent lock;
MASC's optional sidecar uses that public capture too. An independent restored
Agent owns its copy; cross-process intake/one-shot admission remains the host
continuation owner's responsibility.

This changes the exact current checkpoint schema: older versions are refused,
and v12 requires the pending-input field. It adds no conversion, purge, reset or
installation step. Existing checkpoint-version mismatch behavior must be
considered before deployment; source review does not prove a live runtime has
adopted this format.

This first layer repairs the producer/continuation boundary for #38005. It does
not implement the host's current-state HTTP snapshot, snapshot/SSE revision
reconciliation, request-bound settlement relay, or Acting's standing run state.
Those consumers must read the owned continuation and retain server incarnation,
original invocation and request identity. Historical feed events alone cannot
prove a current wait after a replay gap. Keeper quiet/member state stays
independent. #38005 remains open until those paths and their behavior are proven.
