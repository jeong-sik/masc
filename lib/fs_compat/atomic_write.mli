(** Durable atomic write + crash-recovery orphan sweep.

    Owns the durability boundary that protects against partial
    writes, torn renames, and SIGKILL-during-write data loss. The
    contract is [tmp → fsync(tmp) → rename → fsync(parent dir)],
    so a crash between rename and the kernel's dirty-page flush
    cannot leave the target truncated or zero-length. Observed on
    [backlog.json] after an abrupt shutdown on 2026-04-18.

    Crash recovery is provided by [cleanup_atomic_orphans], a
    boot-time sweep for canonical [.atomic_*.tmp] files and legacy
    [.keeper_atomic_*.tmp] files left behind when the owning process
    was SIGKILL'd or temp-file creation itself raised ENFILE/EMFILE
    before the with-handler could register.

    The [save_file] primitive is injected so this module stays free of
    [Fs_compat]'s Eio bridge. Recovery uses only typed [Unix] operations and
    returns every failure to the caller. *)

(** [save_file_atomic ~save_file path content] writes [content] to
    a temp file in [path]'s directory, fsyncs the tmp, renames it
    over [path], and best-effort fsyncs the parent directory.

    Returns [Ok ()] on success or [Error msg] when the write or
    rename fails (the tmp is cleaned up). Re-raises
    [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] after cleaning up the tmp — cancellation
    must not be swallowed (RFC-0143). *)

(** [true] iff [name] matches either the canonical [.atomic_*.tmp]

    re-derive either filename contract — #10205 finding 2. *)

(** #10130: no-follow boot-time cleanup for canonical [.atomic_*.tmp] and
    legacy [.keeper_atomic_*.tmp] orphans.

    [Directory_only] scans exactly [base_path].
    [Directory_and_immediate_subdirectories] additionally scans only real
    immediate child directories; symbolic links are never followed.

    [ownership_root] is the canonical process-owned ancestor of [base_path].
    Every existing component from that root through [base_path] is inspected
    with [lstat] and must be a real directory. A symbolic-link ancestor, a
    non-directory component, or a lexical path outside [ownership_root]
    produces a typed failure before the inventory is read.

    The caller must keep every scanned directory identity process-owned and
    stable, and must ensure no writer creates a matching atomic-temp name
    concurrently. Unrelated entries may change. OCaml 5.4's portable [Unix]
    API has no dirfd-relative [openat]/[unlinkat] operations, so the
    implementation validates inode identity immediately before each mutation
    but cannot make concurrent replacement of an intermediate path component
    atomic. Server startup and the dedicated Keeper staging lifecycle provide
    this ownership boundary.

    Zero-byte regular files are unlinked. Non-empty regular files are
    preserved without overwrite under
    [<base_path>/.recovered/{root,children/<child>}/]. The preservation path
    retains source provenance, uses a hard-link-then-unlink protocol, and
    fsyncs both directory sides. Orphan-shaped non-regular entries and every
    filesystem failure remain in [report.failures]; cancellation is re-raised.
    A missing [base_path] is an empty inventory, not a failure. *)
